### Hi there 👋

📌Hi there, i'm Antonio Lahoz.
I am a Computer science engineering student and an Apple Developer Academy learner.
During my year at the Apple Developer Academy began my interest in the Swift language and in IOS development.

🧑🏻‍💻✨
Thanks to the academy experience i get inspired a lot, I'm improving my hard skills in Swift but i have also some knwoledge in User Experience and in User Interface.
I like to work and develope in team and overcome difficulties together, I really love helping others even in fields that don't belong to me.
